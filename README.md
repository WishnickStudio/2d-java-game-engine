# 2d-java-game-engine

The 2D Java Game Engine has been in development since September of 2018. The goals of the JGE were focused on optimizing the game development proccess for developers with intermediate java knowlage. It is important to note that at this time, this engine does not include any game editor. Anyone interested in using this project should install the project files into a new Java project, as explained in the Getting Started secion below. An API is in development and should be posted here shortly. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

1.) Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ to download the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA.
```
Current Installation:
Version: 2018.2.4
Build: 182.4505.22
```

2.) After installation, import the current gradle

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

run TestComponents.java and input the testID when asked.

### Sprite Class test (testID = 000)

Test the Sprite component by creating an object from class Sprite and return pass/fail for each constructure.

```
test:           create new sprite obj       pass
test:           change spritesheet          pass
test:           return obj's spritesheet    pass
test:           move obj around screen      pass
test:           obj's animation loops       pass

results:        no errors in class 'Sprite'

                Continue [Y] or Exit [N]
```

### Game Class test (testID = 001)

Test the Game component and return pass/fail

```
test:           create new sprite obj       pass
test:           change spritesheet          pass
test:           return obj's spritesheet    pass
test:           move obj around screen      pass
test:           obj's animation loops       pass

results:        no errors in class 'Game'

                Continue [Y] or Exit [N]
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
